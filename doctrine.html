                     <p>The Church is an elect company of believers baptized by the Holy Spirit into one body; its mission is to witness concerning its Head, Jesus Christ, preaching the gospel among all nations; it will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. (Acts 2:41,42; 15:13-17; Ephesians 1:3-6; 1 Corinthians 12:12-13; Matthew 28:19-20; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18)</p>
                     <p>(a) The Church includes only those who are called out of the world by Christ and those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and saviour.  (Acts 2:47)</p>
                     <p>(b) God’s wisdom will be revealed through the Church – not through angelic beings but through the redeemed people of God (Eph. 3:9-11)</p>
                     <p>(c) True believers are already united in the “one body” when they are regenerated by the Holy Spirit according to (I Cor. 12:12,13)  and therefore, one and all believers throughout the world and throughout the ages belong to each other.</p>
                     <p>(d) Two major aspects of the Church, viz. one the local or visible and the other universal or invisible.  True believers assemble together under the headship of Christ.</p>
                     <p>(e) Every local church should be led by elders as seen in the book of Acts. According to I.Pet.2:9 the priesthood of all believers is practiced and any form of ecclesiastical order rejected.</p>
                     <p>(f) The functions of the Church are emphasized, based on Acts 2:41-47 which includes Baptism of new believers, teaching the word of God, fellowship and the Lord’s table, as well as prayers and worship on a weekly basis. The church must actively engage/involve in evangelism, discipleship planting of new assemblies thus ministering to the need of the believers.</p>

                     <p>Baptism must follow repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ;  it cannot precede them in any form.  Water baptism (by immersion) is not to be made a means of salvation or a method of joining the church. (Acts 2:40)</p>

                <p>We practice ‘laying on of hands’ following baptism.  This is to express the existence of a relationship that comes into being when the church ‘lays hands’ up on those who have testified to their union with Christ in baptism: they are by virtue of their testimony in baptism members of the “one body” and they are not alone anymore in the body of Christ.</p>

                     <p>Following the injunction in Mat 28:19  “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost”, the church undertakes to evangelize and involve every believer of the fellowship in this endeavour. The church organizes Gospel raids on government holidays and other occasions to carry out the Lord’s command to preach the Gospel (Math. 28:19.20).  On special occasions such as Holy Convocation, church anniversaries etc, Gospel procession is taken out locally with the permission of the authorities concerned.</p>
